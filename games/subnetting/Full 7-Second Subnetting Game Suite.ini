🧠 Full 7-Second Subnetting Game Suite
Step	Skill	Game Name	Goal
1️⃣	Memorize CIDR → Mask → Hosts	CIDR Flash	Rapid-fire quiz to recall /8–/30 → mask & host count
2️⃣	Identify which octet changes	Changing Octet Challenge	Given a subnet mask, pick which octet changes (1–4)
3️⃣	Compute the magic number	Magic Number Sprint	Given a mask or CIDR, type 256 – (mask octet)
4️⃣	Look at IP’s changing octet value	Octet Focus Drill	Given IP + mask, highlight the changing octet; confirm which digit is decisive
5️⃣	Figure out subnet block range	Block Finder	Given the IP’s changing octet and magic number, choose the correct block range
6️⃣	Derive network address	Network Builder	Given the block range and IP, construct the correct network address
7️⃣	Derive broadcast address	Broadcast Blaster	Given the network and block size, compute broadcast address
8️⃣	Determine host range	Host Range Hustle	Given network/broadcast, pick valid host range
🎯 Step 1: CIDR Flash

Objective: Instantly recall that /27 = 255.255.255.224 = 32 block = 30 hosts.
Gameplay:

You get /26 → you type the mask and number of hosts.

Timed rounds; points for accuracy + speed.

Add hints like “It’s 2ⁿ−2 hosts, where n = bits remaining.”

🎯 Step 2: Changing Octet Challenge

Objective: Quickly recognize which octet is variable.
Gameplay:

You see 255.255.224.0.

You type “3” (third octet changes).

Bonus points if you can also say “/19”.

Hints show the binary pattern.

🎯 Step 3: Magic Number Sprint

Objective: Automate “256 – mask_octet.”
Gameplay:

You see mask 255.255.255.192 → you type “64”.

Or CIDR /26 → you recall the same.

Hints explain the subtraction.

🎯 Step 4: Octet Focus Drill

Objective: Practice spotting the correct octet in an IP.
Gameplay:

Input: IP = 192.168.35.67, Mask = /20.

The game highlights each octet and asks “Which one determines the subnet?”

You answer “3rd.”

Then it shows: “Correct, because /20 = 255.255.240.0, changing at octet 3.”

🎯 Step 5: Block Finder

Objective: Find which subnet block a number falls in.
Gameplay:

You get octet value 77, magic 32.

You must pick the correct block: 64–95.

The app can randomly generate values; you get 3–5 s to respond.

🎯 Step 6: Network Builder

Objective: Apply the block start to rebuild the full network address.
Gameplay:

You get IP = 192.168.10.77, block = 64–95, changing octet = 4th.

You must type “192.168.10.64”.

Hints show the substitution logic: set later octets to 0.

🎯 Step 7: Broadcast Blaster

Objective: Get comfortable setting block end + 255s.
Gameplay:

You get network = 192.168.10.64, block size = 32.

Type broadcast: 192.168.10.95.

Hints remind: “Broadcast = network + block size − 1.”

🎯 Step 8: Host Range Hustle

Objective: Remember usable hosts exclude network/broadcast.
Gameplay:

Given network = 192.168.10.64, broadcast = 192.168.10.95,
answer: 64 + 1 = 65 to 95 − 1 = 94.

Timed recall builds intuition for /30 vs /28 host limits.

🧩 Practice Flow

Start with CIDR Flash until you can instantly recall masks & hosts.

Move to Changing Octet Challenge and Magic Number Sprint (core speed drills).

Then combine Octet Focus → Block Finder → Network Builder → Broadcast → Host Range as a linked chain game later.
